  "content"  : "Let’s explore some basic concepts about probability and Infer.NET\n\nTwo boys or two girls\n\nGiven two children, what is the probability that the two are boys or the two are girls?\n\nProbabilities\n\nSince we are not given any extra information about the two children, then each child is equally likely to be a girl or a boy.\n\nSo the probability that the first child is a boy can be given by:\n\n.\n\nAnd the probability that the second child is a boy can be given by:\n\n.\n\nFrom the complement rule of probability which states that the sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement must equal 1, We get:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThen the probability that the two children are boys is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the probability that the two children are girls is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\nInfer.NET\n\nLet’s see how to represent and solve the above problem using Infer.NET.\n\nTo represent the gender of the child, we can use a binary probability distribution over a boolean value. Where the value of true can represent boy and false can represent girl. In Infer.NET we can do that by creating a random variable and specify its prior distribution to be a Bernoulli distribution (a type of binary distributions).\n\n// a random variable representing the first child is a boy\nVariable&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; first_boy = Variable.Bernoulli(0.5);\n\n// a random variable representing the second child is a boy\nVariable&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; second_boy = Variable.Bernoulli(0.5);\n\n\nNow we can represent the rest of the probabilities using the random variables defined above as follows:\n\n// a derived random variable representing the first child is a girl\nVariable&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; first_girl = !first_boy;\n\n// a derived random variable representing the second child is a girl\nVariable&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; second_girl = !second_boy;\n\n// a derived random variable representing both childs are boys\nVariable&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; both_boys = first_boy &amp;amp; second_boy;\n\n// a derived random variable representing both childs are girls\nVariable&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; both_girls = first_girl &amp;amp; second_girl;\n\n\nTo calculate the value of the derived random variables both_boys and both_girls (i.e. the distribution of these random variables), we need to perform inference. And to perform inference in Infer.NET, we need to use an inference engine.\n\n// create an inference engine\nInferenceEngine engine = new InferenceEngine();\n\n// perform inference on the random variable both_boys\nConsole.WriteLine(&quot;Probability both childs are are boys: &quot; + engine.Infer(both_boys));\n\n// perform inference on the random variable both_girls\nConsole.WriteLine(&quot;Probability both childs are are girls: &quot; + engine.Infer(both_girls));\n\n\nWhen run, this code prints out:\n\nCompiling model...done.\nProbability both childs are are boys: Bernoulli(0.25)\nProbability both childs are are girls: Bernoulli(0.25)\n\n"
